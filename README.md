#Conclusion question_1

Of the 4 approaches (Random Forest, SVM, Nave Bayes, KNN, and Adaboost), it was concluded that the best approach was SVM with an accuracy result of 0.9986130, followed by Na√Øve Bayes with an accuracy result of 0.9753428, and finally KNN(K=6) with an accuracy result of 0.9753428. accuracy 0.9736477. Random Forest cannot be used, because the result given is 1.0 where this value is an approach that is suspected of being Overfitting. Likewise with Adaboost with an accuracy of 0.8441978 but he was wrong in guessing label 1.
